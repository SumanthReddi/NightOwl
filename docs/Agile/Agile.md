# Agile Methodology

Agile is an **iterative and incremental software development approach** where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.

Instead of delivering everything at the end, Agile delivers **working software in small, frequent increments**.

---

## Key Agile Terms

### 🏃 Sprint

* A **time-boxed iteration** where development and testing happen
* Usually **1–4 weeks** (most teams use **2 weeks**)
* Each sprint should deliver a **potentially shippable product increment**

---

### 🛒 Product Backlog

* A **prioritized list of all work items**
* Contains:

  * Epics
  * User Stories
  * Bugs
  * Technical tasks
* Owned and prioritized by the **Product Owner**

---

### ⭕ Epic

* A **high-level business objective**
* Too large to complete in a single sprint
* Broken down into multiple user stories

**Example:**
Online Credit Card Application Flow

---

### 🔰 User Story (US)

* A **requirement written from the end-user’s perspective**
* Focuses on *who*, *what*, and *why*

**Format:**

```
As a <user>,
I want <feature>,
So that <benefit>.
```

---

### ✅ Task

* A **small, actionable unit of work**
* Created by the team from user stories
* Assigned to developers or QA

---

## Agile Team Roles

### 🤵 Product Owner (PO)

* Owns the **product vision and roadmap**
* Manages and prioritizes the **product backlog**
* Accepts or rejects completed user stories

---

### 😎 Scrum Master

* Facilitates Agile ceremonies
* Removes **impediments/blockers**
* Ensures the team follows **Scrum practices**
* Acts as a **servant leader** (not a manager)

---

### 🤔 Business Analyst (BA)

* Translates business needs into **clear user stories**
* Clarifies:

  * Business rules
  * Acceptance criteria
  * Edge cases
* In some teams, BA responsibilities are handled by the PO

---

### 👨‍💻 Developers

* Design, develop, and unit-test the application
* Responsible for delivering **working code** in each sprint

---

### 🕺 QA / Test Team

* Validate user stories against acceptance criteria
* Perform:

  * Functional testing
  * Regression testing
  * Automation testing
* Ensure quality before release

---

### 👬 DevOps

* Manages:

  * CI/CD pipelines
  * Builds and deployments
  * Infrastructure and environments
* Enables **faster and reliable releases**

---

## Agile Process (Scrum Ceremonies)

### 🔻 Sprint Planning

* Conducted at the **start of the sprint**
* Team:

  * Reviews backlog items
  * Estimates effort
  * Commits stories based on capacity

---

### 🔻 Daily Scrum / Stand-up

* **15-minute daily meeting**
* Each member answers:

  * What did I do yesterday?
  * What will I do today?
  * Any blockers?

---

### 🔻 Sprint Review / Demo

* Conducted at the **end of the sprint**
* Team demonstrates completed features to stakeholders
* Feedback is captured for future sprints

---

### 🔻 Sprint Retrospective

* Conducted after sprint review
* Focuses on **process improvement**
* Discusses:

  * What went well?
  * What didn’t go well?
  * What can be improved?

## Advantages of Agile Methodology

✅ Delivers working software frequently
✅ Early detection of defects and risks
✅ Flexible to changing requirements
✅ Strong collaboration across teams
✅ Continuous improvement through retrospectives
