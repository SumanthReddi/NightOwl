## WHAT IS TestNG \& WHY USE IT? 

**TestNG** = "Test Next Generation" - evolved from JUnit/NUnit specifically for **enterprise test automation** (Selenium, API, mobile).

**Core Philosophy:**

- **Structured execution** with lifecycle hooks
- **Data-driven testing** without code duplication
- **Parallel execution** - Selenium's biggest bottleneck solved
- **Rich reporting** - HTML + XML + ExtentReports integration

**Why Selenium + TestNG?** JUnit lacks parallel execution, groups, and DataProvider. TestNG runs 5x faster for Selenium suites.
