# Maven Project Structure

One of the biggest advantages of Maven is that it enforces a **standard project structure**.  
For automation testing engineers, this structure brings **clarity, consistency, and scalability**.

Understanding this structure is **mandatory** before working with `pom.xml`, TestNG, or CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Why Project Structure Matters in Automation

In automation projects:
- Tests grow rapidly
- Multiple engineers contribute
- CI tools execute tests automatically

A standard structure ensures:
- Everyone knows where code belongs
- Tools work without extra configuration
- Maintenance becomes easier

Maven solves this by defining **convention over configuration**.

---

## Standard Maven Project Layout

```text
project-root/
│
├─ pom.xml
│
├─ src/
│   ├─ main/
│   │   ├─ java/
│   │   └─ resources/
│   │
│   └─ test/
│       ├─ java/
│       └─ resources/
│
└─ target/
```

Each folder has a **specific purpose**.

---

## `pom.xml` (Project Object Model)

```text
pom.xml
```

- Heart of the Maven project
- Defines dependencies, plugins, build rules
- Controls how tests are executed

👉 This will be covered in detail in the **pom.xml – MASTER CONTROL FILE** section.

---

## `src/main/java`

```text
src/main/java
```

### Purpose
- Application source code (rare in pure automation projects)

### In Automation Projects
Usually contains:
- Utility classes
- Framework core code
- API clients
- Custom libraries

Example:
```text
src/main/java
 └─ framework/
     ├─ driver/
     ├─ utils/
     └─ config/
```

---

## `src/main/resources`

```text
src/main/resources
```

### Purpose
- Non-Java resources required by main code

Examples:
- `log4j.properties`
- `application.properties`
- JSON / XML templates
- Environment configs

These files are automatically added to the classpath.

---

## `src/test/java` ⭐ (Most Important for Automation)

```text
src/test/java
```

### Purpose
- All test-related Java code

This is where you place:
- TestNG test classes
- Test classes using Selenium / RestAssured
- Step definitions
- Test runners

Example structure:
```text
src/test/java
 └─ tests/
     ├─ login/
     ├─ payment/
     └─ regression/
```

Maven automatically treats this folder as **test code**.

---

## `src/test/resources`

```text
src/test/resources
```

### Purpose
- Test-specific non-Java files

Common contents:
- `testng.xml`
- Test data files (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- Environment config files
- Feature files (BDD)

Example:
```text
src/test/resources
 ├─ testng/
 │   ├─ smoke.xml
 │   └─ regression.xml
 ├─ testdata/
 └─ config/
```

---

## `target/` Directory

```text
target/
```

### Purpose
- Generated by Maven during build
- Contains compiled code, reports, logs

Common contents:
- `surefire-reports`
- TestNG reports
- Compiled `.class` files

⚠️ This folder should **never be committed** to Git.

---

## How Maven Uses This Structure

When you run:
```bash
mvn test
```

Maven automatically:
1. Compiles code in `src/main/java`
2. Compiles code in `src/test/java`
3. Loads resources from `src/*/resources`
4. Executes tests
5. Generates reports in `target/`

No extra configuration required.

---

## Automation Engineer Best Practices

- Keep **framework code** in `src/main/java`
- Keep **tests only** in `src/test/java`
- Store `testng.xml` in `src/test/resources`
- Organize tests by feature or module
- Never hardcode environment values in code

---

## Common Mistakes

- Placing tests in `src/main/java`
- Mixing framework and test logic
- Committing `target/` directory
- Storing credentials in source code
- Ignoring resource folders

---

## Key Takeaways

- Maven project structure is **fixed and intentional**
- Automation tools rely on this structure
- Correct structure reduces configuration effort
- CI/CD works smoothly with standard layout
- Mastering this structure is essential before `pom.xml`
