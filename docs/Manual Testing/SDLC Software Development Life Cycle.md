# SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle

SDLC defines **how software is planned, built, tested, deployed, and maintained**.
For testers, understanding SDLC is critical to know **when to test, what to test, and how to add value at each stage**.

Testing is not a separate activity — it is **embedded throughout SDLC**.

---

## What is SDLC?

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process that ensures:
- Software is built systematically
- Quality is maintained
- Risks are reduced
- Stakeholders are aligned

In simple terms:
> SDLC explains **how an idea becomes a working software product**.

---

## Why Testers Must Understand SDLC

A tester who understands SDLC can:
- Participate early (shift-left)
- Prevent defects instead of just finding them
- Communicate effectively with developers and managers
- Align testing with business goals

---

## SDLC Phases (High-Level)

Typical SDLC consists of the following phases:

1. Requirement Analysis  
2. Design  
3. Development  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  
6. Maintenance  

Each phase has a **tester responsibility**.

---

## 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis Phase

### What Happens
- Business requirements are gathered
- Functional expectations are defined

### Tester’s Role
- Review requirements
- Identify ambiguities
- Raise questions
- Start thinking about test scenarios

Early involvement saves cost.

---

## 2️⃣ Design Phase

### What Happens
- System architecture is created
- Technical design is prepared

### Tester’s Role
- Review design documents (awareness)
- Understand data flow
- Identify integration points
- Think about test environment needs

---

## 3️⃣ Development Phase

### What Happens
- Developers write code
- Unit testing is performed

### Tester’s Role
- Clarify requirements
- Prepare test cases
- Prepare test data
- Coordinate with developers

Testing preparation runs **in parallel**, not after development.

---

## 4️⃣ Testing Phase

### What Happens
- Test cases are executed
- Defects are reported
- Regression testing is performed

### Tester’s Role
- Execute manual tests
- Perform functional and regression testing
- Validate fixes
- Provide quality sign-off

This is where testers are most visible — but not the only place they add value.

---

## 5️⃣ Deployment Phase

### What Happens
- Application is released to production or UAT

### Tester’s Role
- Perform smoke testing
- Validate critical functionality
- Support UAT testing
- Assist release validation

---

## 6️⃣ Maintenance Phase

### What Happens
- Bugs are fixed
- Enhancements are added

### Tester’s Role
- Regression testing
- Validate bug fixes
- Ensure no impact on existing features

---

## SDLC Models (Overview)

### Waterfall Model
- Sequential phases
- Testing happens late

Pros:
- Simple structure

Cons:
- Late defect discovery
- High rework cost

---

### Agile Model (Preview)

- Iterative development
- Testing happens continuously

Pros:
- Early feedback
- Faster delivery

Agile testing is covered separately in detail.

---

## Common SDLC Misconceptions ❌

- Testing is only one phase
- Testers join after development
- Quality is tester’s responsibility alone

Reality:
> Quality is a **shared responsibility** across SDLC.

---

## Interview-Ready Questions

**Q: Why is SDLC important for testers?**  
A: It helps testers plan testing activities and contribute early.

**Q: When does testing start in SDLC?**  
A: From the requirement analysis phase.

---

## Key Takeaways

- SDLC defines the software journey
- Testers play a role in every phase
- Early testing reduces cost and defects
- Testing is continuous, not a single step
- SDLC understanding improves tester effectiveness
