# Manual Testing in Real Projects

This section connects **all manual testing concepts** into a **real project workflow**.
It explains what testers actually do **day-to-day**, beyond definitions and theory.

---

## How Manual Testing Starts in a Project

Manual testing begins **before development is complete**.

Typical starting points:
- Requirement discussions
- Backlog grooming
- Design walkthroughs

Tester mindset:
> Testing starts early, not after coding.

---

## End-to-End Manual Testing Workflow

```
Requirement Analysis
        ↓
Test Scenarios
        ↓
Test Case Design
        ↓
Test Data Preparation
        ↓
Test Execution
        ↓
Defect Reporting
        ↓
Regression Testing
        ↓
Release Sign-off
```

This flow repeats every sprint or release.

## Day-to-Day Activities of a Tester

- Attend stand-up meetings
- Clarify requirements
- Design test scenarios and cases
- Execute test cases
- Log and track defects
- Perform regression testing
- Update test reports
- Communicate risks

---

## Handling Changes in Real Projects

Changes are constant:
- Requirement changes
- UI updates
- Backend changes
- Integration changes

Tester actions:
- Analyze impact
- Update scenarios and test cases
- Prioritize regression
- Communicate risks early

---

## Working with Developers

Good tester–developer collaboration includes:
- Clear defect reporting
- Respectful communication
- Joint debugging
- Quick clarifications

Avoid:
- Blame culture
- Vague defects
- Delayed communication

---

## Handling Tight Deadlines

When time is limited:
- Focus on high-risk areas
- Run smoke tests first
- Prioritize core business flows
- Communicate coverage gaps

Risk-based testing becomes critical here.

---

## Common Challenges Testers Face

- Unclear requirements
- Unstable environments
- Frequent changes
- Limited time
- Conflicting priorities

Strong testers:
> Adapt without compromising quality.

---

## Manual Testing and Automation Connection

Manual testing:
- Identifies scenarios
- Finds edge cases
- Validates usability

Automation:
- Covers regression
- Saves time
- Improves consistency

Manual testing **feeds automation**, it does not compete with it.

---

## Interview-Ready Questions

**Q: Describe your day-to-day activities as a tester.**  
A: Requirement analysis, test design, execution, defect reporting, and collaboration.

**Q: How do you handle last-minute changes?**  
A: Impact analysis, prioritize risk, and communicate clearly.

## Key Takeaways

- Manual testing is continuous
- Real projects are dynamic
- Communication is as important as testing
- Risk-based thinking is essential
- Manual testing builds automation foundation
