# Manual Testing Interview Questions

This section consolidates **frequently asked manual testing interview questions** with **clear, practical answers**.
The focus is on **real project thinking**, not textbook definitions.

---

## 1️⃣ What is Software Testing?

Software testing is the process of verifying and validating that a software application meets requirements and works as expected, with the goal of reducing risk and ensuring quality.

---

## 2️⃣ Why is Testing Required?

Testing is required to:
- Identify defects early
- Reduce business risk
- Improve product quality
- Prevent production failures

---

## 3️⃣ What is the Difference Between Verification and Validation?

- **Verification** checks whether the product is built correctly.
- **Validation** checks whether the correct product is built.

---

## 4️⃣ What is SDLC and STLC?

- **SDLC** explains how software is developed.
- **STLC** explains how testing activities are planned and executed.

---

## 5️⃣ What are the Levels of Testing?

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing (UAT)

---

## 6️⃣ Smoke Testing vs Sanity Testing?

- **Smoke Testing** checks build stability.
- **Sanity Testing** verifies specific changes or bug fixes.

---

## 7️⃣ What is Regression Testing?

Regression testing ensures existing functionality works after changes. It is the **best candidate for automation**.

---

## 8️⃣ What is a Test Scenario?

A test scenario is a high-level description of what needs to be tested, derived from requirements.

---

## 9️⃣ Test Scenario vs Test Case?

- Scenario → WHAT to test
- Test Case → HOW to test

---

## 🔟 What is a Defect?

A defect is a deviation between expected and actual behavior.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Severity vs Priority?

- **Severity**: Impact on system
- **Priority**: Urgency to fix

They are independent.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What is a Test Plan?

A test plan defines scope, approach, schedule, and resources for testing a specific project.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What is Risk-Based Testing?

Risk-based testing prioritizes testing based on business and technical risk.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What is Agile Testing?

Agile testing is continuous testing performed throughout development in Agile projects.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ What is UAT?

UAT is testing performed by business users to validate acceptance.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Can Testers Test in Production?

Only limited smoke testing is allowed after deployment. Full testing is not permitted.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Manual Testing vs Automation Testing?

Manual testing explores and validates behavior; automation supports regression and repetition.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ What Makes a Good Tester?

- Strong requirement understanding
- Attention to detail
- Risk-based thinking
- Clear communication

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ How Do You Handle Tight Deadlines?

By prioritizing high-risk areas, running smoke tests first, and communicating coverage risks.

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ What Are Common Tester Mistakes?

- Skipping requirement analysis
- Poor defect reporting
- Automating unstable features
- Ignoring risk

---

## Final Interview Tip 🎯

Interviewers look for:
- Clear thinking
- Practical examples
- Risk awareness
- Communication skills

Not just definitions.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Manual testing concepts are interconnected
- Real project understanding matters
- Strong fundamentals build strong automation engineers
