# Agile Testing Basics

Agile testing is not a phase — it is a **continuous activity** performed throughout development.
In Agile projects, testers work **closely with developers and business**, not at the end.

Understanding Agile testing is **mandatory for modern QA roles**.

---

## What is Agile?

Agile is an **iterative and incremental development approach** focused on:
- Faster delivery
- Continuous feedback
- Adaptability to change

Key idea:
> Deliver working software frequently.

## Agile vs Waterfall (Tester Perspective)

| Aspect | Waterfall | Agile |
|---|---|---|
| Development | Sequential | Iterative |
| Testing | After development | Continuous |
| Feedback | Late | Early |
| Change handling | Difficult | Easy |

Agile reduces risk by **testing early and often**.

## Scrum Framework (Common in Projects)

### Key Roles

**Product Owner**
- Owns requirements
- Defines priorities
- Accepts or rejects work

**Scrum Master**
- Facilitates Agile process
- Removes blockers

**Development Team**
- Developers
- Testers
- Work together as one team

---

## Agile Ceremonies (Tester Involvement)

### Sprint Planning
- Understand user stories
- Ask questions
- Identify test scenarios

### Daily Stand-up
- Share testing status
- Raise blockers

### Sprint Review
- Demo completed work
- Validate acceptance criteria

### Sprint Retrospective
- Discuss what went well
- Identify improvements

---

## User Stories

A user story describes functionality from **user perspective**.

Format:
```
As a <user>
I want <feature>
So that <benefit>
```

Tester focus:
- Clarify story
- Identify scenarios
- Validate acceptance criteria

---

## Acceptance Criteria (VERY IMPORTANT)

Acceptance criteria define **conditions of satisfaction**.

Examples:
- Valid input accepted
- Invalid input rejected
- Error message displayed

Rule:
> If acceptance criteria pass, story is considered done.

---

## Tester Role in Agile Sprint

Testers:
- Participate from day one
- Design tests early
- Test continuously
- Collaborate closely
- Support automation

Testing is **shifted left**, not delayed.

---

## Agile Testing Quadrants (Awareness)

- Q1: Unit & component tests
- Q2: Functional & exploratory tests
- Q3: Performance, security tests
- Q4: Acceptance & UAT tests

Helps balance test coverage.

---

## Common Agile Testing Mistakes ❌

- Treating Agile like Waterfall
- Waiting for development to finish
- Ignoring acceptance criteria
- Skipping regression

---

## Interview-Ready Questions

**Q: What is Agile testing?**  
A: Continuous testing throughout development.

**Q: What is acceptance criteria?**  
A: Conditions that must be met for a story to be accepted.

## Key Takeaways

- Agile testing is continuous
- Testers are part of the team
- Early testing reduces risk
- Acceptance criteria drive testing
- Collaboration is key
