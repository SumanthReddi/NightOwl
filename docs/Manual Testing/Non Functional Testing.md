# Non Functional Testing (Awareness)

Non-functional testing focuses on **how well the system works**, not just what it does.
For manual testers, this section builds **awareness**, so issues are identified early and escalated correctly.

This is **not tool-level training** — it is **tester-level understanding**.

---

## Why Non-Functional Testing Matters

Even if functionality works, users may still reject the system due to:
- Slowness
- Security risks
- Poor usability
- Incompatibility

Key idea:
> Functional correctness ≠ Product quality

---

## Major Types of Non-Functional Testing

### 1️⃣ Performance Testing (Awareness)

#### What it checks
- Response time
- Throughput
- Stability under load

Examples of tester observations:
- Login takes too long
- Search becomes slow with large data
- Application hangs under usage

Tester role:
- Identify performance risks
- Raise issues early
- Support performance testing teams

---

### 2️⃣ Security Testing (Awareness)

#### What it checks
- Data protection
- Authentication & authorization
- Vulnerability exposure

Examples:
- Password visible in plain text
- Unauthorized access to pages
- Session not invalidated after logout

Tester role:
- Think like an attacker
- Validate basic security behavior
- Escalate risks

---

### 3️⃣ Usability Testing

#### What it checks
- Ease of use
- User experience
- Clarity of messages

Examples:
- Confusing error messages
- Poor navigation
- Unclear labels

Tester mindset:
> If user struggles, it’s a defect.

---

### 4️⃣ Compatibility Testing

#### What it checks
- Browser compatibility
- OS compatibility
- Device compatibility

Examples:
- Works in Chrome, fails in Firefox
- Mobile layout issues

Tester role:
- Identify platform-specific issues
- Validate supported environments

---

### 5️⃣ Reliability & Stability Testing (Awareness)

#### What it checks
- Application stability over time
- Crash handling
- Recovery behavior

Examples:
- App crashes after long usage
- Session expires unexpectedly

---

## Non-Functional Testing in Real Projects

Manual testers usually:
- Observe issues during functional testing
- Log non-functional defects
- Collaborate with specialized teams

You are not expected to:
❌ Design performance scripts  
❌ Run security tools  

But you **must recognize problems**.

---

## Common Misconceptions ❌

- Non-functional testing is optional ❌
- Only performance team handles it ❌
- Manual testers have no role ❌

Reality:
> Awareness prevents major production issues.

## Interview-Ready Questions

**Q: Difference between functional and non-functional testing?**  
A: Functional checks what the system does; non-functional checks how well it does it.

**Q: Can manual testers find performance issues?**  
A: Yes, through observation and early escalation.

## Key Takeaways

- Non-functional testing ensures product quality
- Manual testers play an awareness role
- Performance, security, usability matter
- Early detection saves cost
- Good testers think beyond functionality
