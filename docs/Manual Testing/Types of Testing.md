# Types of Testing

Software testing can be classified in multiple ways.
Understanding **types of testing** helps testers decide **what to test, when to test, and why to test**.

This section builds clarity that is essential for **manual testing, automation, API testing, and interviews**.

---

## Why Classification of Testing is Needed

Testing cannot be random.
Different types of testing focus on:
- Different objectives
- Different risks
- Different stages of the project

Correct classification ensures:
- Better coverage
- Reduced duplication
- Smarter testing effort

---

## High-Level Classification of Testing

Testing is broadly classified into:

1. Functional Testing  
2. Non-Functional Testing  
3. Manual Testing vs Automation Testing  
4. Static Testing vs Dynamic Testing  

---

## 1️⃣ Functional Testing

### What is Functional Testing?

Functional testing verifies:
- **What the system does**
- Whether the application behaves according to requirements

Focus:
> Business functionality

Examples:
- Login functionality
- Payment processing
- Order placement
- Error messages

---

### Functional Testing Characteristics

- Based on requirements
- Black-box testing
- Input → Process → Output validation

Tester responsibility:
- Validate both positive and negative scenarios

---

## 2️⃣ Non-Functional Testing (Awareness)

### What is Non-Functional Testing?

Non-functional testing verifies:
- **How the system performs**
- System characteristics rather than functionality

Examples:
- Performance
- Security
- Usability
- Reliability

Tester role:
- Awareness and validation support
- Not tool-heavy at this stage

---

## 3️⃣ Manual Testing vs Automation Testing

### Manual Testing
- Tests executed by humans
- Exploratory and ad-hoc friendly
- Required for UI/UX and usability

### Automation Testing
- Tests executed using tools/scripts
- Fast and repeatable
- Best for regression testing

Key point:
> Automation supports testing — it does not replace manual testing.

---

## 4️⃣ Static Testing vs Dynamic Testing

### Static Testing
- Testing without executing code
- Performed on documents and designs

Examples:
- Requirement reviews
- Design walkthroughs

### Dynamic Testing
- Testing by executing the application

Examples:
- Functional testing
- Regression testing

---

## Functional vs Non-Functional Testing (Comparison)

| Aspect | Functional | Non-Functional |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | What system does | How system behaves |
| Based on | Requirements | Quality attributes |
| Examples | Login, payment | Performance, security |

---

## Common Testing Misconceptions ❌

- Non-functional testing is optional ❌
- Automation testing means no manual testing ❌
- Static testing is not real testing ❌

Reality:
> Each testing type has its own purpose.

---

## Interview-Ready Questions

**Q: What are the main types of testing?**  
A: Functional, non-functional, static, and dynamic testing.

**Q: Is automation testing a type of testing?**  
A: No, it is a way of executing tests.

## Key Takeaways

- Testing is classified for clarity and control
- Functional testing validates behavior
- Non-functional testing validates quality attributes
- Manual and automation coexist
- Static testing helps catch issues early
