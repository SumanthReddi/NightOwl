# STLC – Software Testing Life Cycle

STLC explains **how testing activities are planned, executed, and closed**.
While SDLC explains how software is built, **STLC explains how testing is done** in a structured and controlled way.

For testers, STLC represents the **day-to-day workflow** in real projects.

---

## What is STLC?

**Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** is a sequence of activities performed by the testing team to:
- Ensure quality
- Reduce risk
- Deliver a stable product

In simple words:
> STLC explains **how testers work from requirement to release**.

---

## Why STLC is Important

STLC helps testers:
- Plan testing properly
- Avoid ad-hoc testing
- Track progress
- Control quality
- Provide clear sign-off

Projects without STLC usually suffer from:
- Missed test coverage
- Poor reporting
- Last-minute chaos

---

## STLC Phases (Complete Flow)

1. Requirement Analysis  
2. Test Planning  
3. Test Case Design  
4. Test Environment Setup  
5. Test Execution  
6. Test Closure  

Each phase has **entry and exit criteria**.

---

## 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis (STLC)

### Activities
- Analyze functional requirements
- Identify testable requirements
- Identify test scenarios
- Clarify ambiguities

### Deliverables
- Test scenarios
- Requirement questions
- Initial test strategy inputs

---

## 2️⃣ Test Planning

### Activities
- Define test scope
- Identify test types
- Estimate effort
- Identify risks
- Decide test approach

### Deliverables
- Test plan document
- Test schedule
- Resource allocation

Tester note:
> Good test planning prevents last-minute surprises.

---

## 3️⃣ Test Case Design

### Activities
- Write test cases
- Prepare test data
- Review test cases

### Deliverables
- Test cases
- Test data
- Review comments

This phase heavily depends on **requirement clarity**.

---

## 4️⃣ Test Environment Setup

### Activities
- Verify test environment readiness
- Validate access
- Check test data availability

### Environment Examples
- QA
- UAT
- Staging

Without a stable environment, testing cannot proceed.

---

## 5️⃣ Test Execution

### Activities
- Execute test cases
- Mark pass/fail/block
- Log defects
- Perform regression testing

### Deliverables
- Execution results
- Defect reports
- Daily status reports

---

## 6️⃣ Test Closure

### Activities
- Evaluate test completion
- Analyze defects
- Prepare test summary report
- Get sign-off

### Deliverables
- Test closure report
- Lessons learned

This phase provides **confidence to release**.

---

## Entry & Exit Criteria (Important)

### Entry Criteria
- Requirements approved
- Environment ready
- Test cases reviewed

### Exit Criteria
- Critical defects closed
- Test coverage achieved
- Stakeholder sign-off

---

## STLC vs SDLC

| Aspect | SDLC | STLC |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Development | Testing |
| Owner | Dev + Mgmt | QA |
| Scope | End-to-end | Test activities |
| Nature | Product-centric | Quality-centric |

---

## Common STLC Mistakes ❌

- Skipping test planning
- Rushing test case design
- Ignoring exit criteria
- Poor test closure

---

## Interview-Ready Questions

**Q: What is STLC?**  
A: A structured approach to plan, execute, and close testing activities.

**Q: Why is STLC important?**  
A: It ensures quality, traceability, and controlled testing.

---

## Key Takeaways

- STLC defines tester workflow
- Each phase has clear deliverables
- Entry & exit criteria control quality
- Strong STLC leads to predictable testing
- Essential for real projects and interviews
