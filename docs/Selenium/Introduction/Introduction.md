# Introduction to Selenium

Selenium is the most widely used **open-source automation tool for web applications**.
It is designed to automate **real user interactions on browsers**, making it ideal
for functional UI testing in modern software projects.

---

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is a **suite of tools** that allows automation engineers to:
- Control real browsers
- Simulate user actions
- Validate web application behavior

Selenium works with:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

And supports multiple programming languages:
- Java
- Python
- C#
- JavaScript

---

## What Selenium Is Used For

Selenium is primarily used for:
- Functional UI automation
- Regression testing
- Cross-browser testing
- End-to-end workflows

It is commonly integrated with:
- TestNG / JUnit
- Maven / Gradle
- CI/CD pipelines
- Selenium Grid / Cloud platforms

---

## What Selenium Is NOT

It is equally important to understand Selenium’s limitations.

Selenium is **NOT** used for:
- Performance testing
- Load testing
- Security testing
- Desktop application testing
- Mobile app testing (Appium is used instead)

---

## Why Selenium is Still Relevant

Despite newer tools, Selenium remains dominant because:
- It supports **all major browsers**
- It is **open-source and flexible**
- It integrates well with CI/CD
- It has a massive community
- Most enterprises still rely on Selenium

## Selenium vs Other Tools (Awareness)

| Tool | Primary Focus |
|---|---|
| Selenium | Cross-browser UI automation |
| Cypress | Frontend JS apps |
| Playwright | Modern browser automation |

Selenium excels where **browser diversity and enterprise support** are required.

---

## Real Project Usage

In real projects, Selenium is used with:
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Test frameworks (TestNG / Cucumber)
- Parallel execution
- Reporting tools
- Cloud grids (Sauce Labs, BrowserStack)

---

## Key Takeaways

- Selenium automates real browsers
- Best suited for UI functional testing
- Not meant for performance or security testing
- Industry-standard automation tool
